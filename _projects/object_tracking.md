In this project, an event-based camera was used to develop a functional proof of concept for a procedural 3-D cube tracking system. Hough space shape detection was used to track the position of cube edges in the image space, and an optimization-based algorithm was used in
conjunction for finding the pose of the cube. Additionally, a ghosting effect was seen following the trailing edge of events. A sensor model was developed for simulating and investigating this
phenomenon.
