In this project, robotics meets art! A 7 DOF Franka Panda arm, "BotROS", was programmed to autonomously create pointilist-style artwork. 

BotROS is provided with a canvas, paint brushes, and a palette.
It will pick up a brush, dip it in a color, and will begin painting some dots! It will return for more paint every 8 dots. Once the first color is complete, it will return its brush and pick up a new one before initiating a second round of color.
