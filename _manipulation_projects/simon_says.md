The Allegro Hand is a robotic hand with four fingers and 16 degrees of freedom. In this project, it is used to play a challenging Simon Says game with a human player. The hand performs increasingly longer sequences of gestures that the player must mimic in the correct order. 

## Video Demo

<!-- TODO: update game video demo -->

Disclaimer: The ring finger of the hand currently has a broken gearbox at its base joint. Once it is repaired the video will be re-filmed with some more interesting gestures!
